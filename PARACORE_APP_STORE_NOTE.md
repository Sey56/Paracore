💡 **A Note from the Developer**

Paracore was born from a real need. As an Architect who codes, I found the traditional Revit API workflow—compiling DLLs, restarting Revit, and managing manifests—to be painfully slow. I needed a way to prototype and build automation tools instantly, without the overhead of a full software engineering environment.

We built Paracore to solve this crisis. It provides a Dynamic Execution Engine that treats C# like a scripting language, giving you the power of the Revit API with the speed of web development. It is designed to bridge the gap between heavy enterprise development and nimble, day-to-day automation. 

I hope this tool empowers you to build your own solutions as much as it has empowered me.

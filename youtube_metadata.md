## Description Template

Welcome to Day 03 of our tutorial series on the **Paracore Ecosystem**! 🚀

In this session, we go beyond basic scripts and examine the core architecture of the **Paracore Platform**. We'll look at how the various components (App, Revit Add-in, and VS Code) communicate and coordinate for professional BIM automation. We dive into the **v1.1.1** features, including the updated sync engine.

### 🔥 Day 3 Highlights:
- **The v1.1.1 Smart-Sync Engine**: Watch as parameters and metadata update automatically in the background while you code in VS Code. 
- **Ephemeral Workspaces**: How Paracore manages isolated, high-performance environments for your scripts.
- **The "Zero Setup" Advantage**: A direct side-by-side comparison between the traditional Revit SDK approach vs. the lightning-fast Paracore workflow.
- **Manual Overrides & Persistence**: Learn how Paracore respects your UI edits even while you're updating your source code.
